# Python Variable Annotations 🐍✨

## Description 📝

This project focuses on implementing type annotations in Python 3, a powerful feature that helps ensure code correctness and improves documentation. Through a series of tasks, we'll explore how type annotations can be used to specify function signatures, variable types, and work with complex data structures.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Type annotations in Python 3 and their benefits
- How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- The concept of duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements 📋

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.9
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and functions must be documented

## Resources 📚

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Tasks 📌

### Task 0: Basic annotations - add ➕

Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 1: Basic annotations - concat 🔗

Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two string arguments and returns a concatenated string.

### Task 2: Basic annotations - floor 📊

Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float argument and returns its floor as an integer.

### Task 3: Basic annotations - to string 🔤

Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float argument and returns its string representation.

### Task 4: Define variables 🧩

Define and annotate four variables with specific values and types.

### Task 5: Complex types - list of floats 📋

Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` that calculates the sum of a list of floats.

### Task 6: Complex types - mixed list 🔄

Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` that calculates the sum of a list containing both integers and floats.

### Task 7: Complex types - string and int/float to tuple 📦

Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string and either an int or float, returning a tuple.

### Task 8: Complex types - functions 🧮

Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that returns a function for multiplying floats.

### Task 9: Duck typing - iterable object 🦆

Annotate a function that works with iterables, demonstrating duck typing principles.
